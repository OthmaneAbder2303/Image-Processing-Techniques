This repository is a comprehensive collection of MATLAB implementations and examples for various fundamental and advanced image processing techniques. It's designed for students, researchers, and developers who want to learn, practice, and apply common image processing algorithms using the powerful MATLAB environment.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- **MATLAB** (R2018a or newer recommended)
- **Image Processing Toolbox**: Required for most functions
- Basic knowledge of MATLAB programming

### Installation
Clone the repository and navigate to the relevant subfolders:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/OthmaneAbder2303/Image-Processing-Techniques.git
cd Image-Processing-Techniques
```

# Key Techniques Covered

## 1. Histogram Analysis
- **Image Histogram Calculation**: Visualizing pixel intensity distributions
- **Histogram Equalization**: Automatic contrast enhancement

- **Adaptive Histogram Equalization (CLAHE)**: Local contrast enhancement

## 2. Image Filtering
### Spatial Domain Filters:
- **Smoothing**: Gaussian, Mean, Median filters
- **Sharpening**: Laplacian, Unsharp masking
- **Edge-preserving**: Bilateral filter

### Frequency Domain Filters:
- **Low-pass**: Ideal, Gaussian
